# Hi there! 👋

I'm Charlie Barker, a researcher in **computational cancer biology** with deep expertise in integrative multi-omics analysis and predictive modelling.
My passions lie in translating complex data into actionable insights for the development of next-gen therapies.

- 🔬 Research Fellow, UCL — Computational models for cancer therapies  
- 🧬 Ph.D., EMBL-EBI / University of Cambridge — Network-based modelling of signalling  
- 👨‍🏫 Instructor, Keynote speaker, and student supervisor

## 🧪 Current Projects

- 🧩 **Multi-omics network integration**  
Building signalling networks from genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data to understand therapy-induced reprogramming in melanoma.

- 🧬 **NSCLC therapy prediction model**
A mechanistic in silico model of oncogenic signalling (EGFR, AKT, JAK/STAT, WNT) to simulate drug and radiotherapy responses in NSCLC. Identified resistance mechanisms, novel targets (e.g. 53BP1), and a 19-gene signature for patient stratification.

- 🦠 **Morphology-informed signalling in breast cancer**
Integrated RNA-seq and imaging data to uncover how cell shape relates to transcriptomic and signalling changes in breast cancer. Identified novel regulatory networks involving WNT, Notch, and RAP1–NF-kB signalling that mediate mechanical sensing and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
